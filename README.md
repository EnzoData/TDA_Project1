# Topological Data Analysis Project 1

## Introduction
It is apparent that within the field of Data Science, Topology is beginning to be heavily used for data analysis. Our main focus for this project is classification. Our objective is to build a successful training model to predict letters from the Latin alphabet through the process of persistent homology. Before delving in our process for achiving our objective, let's first identify and define some key concepts that will be used. 



Using the notebook Lower Star Image Filtrations from ripser.py weâ€™re identifying 0-Dimensional classes in each letter to classify them through their Euclidean coordinates.
A dataset created by reading a 10x10 pixel image for each letter in the latin alphabet where the pixel values are 0 if there is no part of the letter and 1 otherwise.

### Types of Scans
In the folder link below, there are examples of scanning methods used on the latin alphabet. These scanning methods are as follows: left to right, right to left,  top to bottom with each letter rotated 90 degrees, and bottom to top with each letter rotated 90 degrees.

## Algorithm
(code submitted)


## Experiments
Testing 8 sparse letters - Enzo and Shane 

## Discussion 
why we went from 8 scans to 4 scans with 5 density scans
robustness 
From the algorithm produced and the results, we can see that classification was sucessful on the original 26 letter

## Criticism
