# Topological Data Analysis Project 1

## Introduction
### what our obejctive is 
### types of scans-Enzo

## Algorithm
### what the algorithm is;
### drawbacks of algorithm-Shane

## Experiments
Testing 8 sparse letters - Enzo and Shane 

## Discussion 
why we went from 8 scans to 4 scans with 5 density scans
robustness 
From the algorithm produced and the results, we can see that classification was sucessful on the original 26 letter
